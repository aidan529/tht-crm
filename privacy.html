  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 13, 2026</p>

  <p>The Headline Theory ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting the privacy of our clients and their contacts. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard information in connection with our lead generation and outreach services.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We collect business contact information provided by our clients during onboarding, including company name, contact name, email address, phone number, and business address. We also collect information from publicly available business sources for the purpose of B2B lead generation on behalf of our clients.</p>
  <p>When clients sign up for our services, we collect their name, business name, email address, phone number, and payment information necessary to provide our services.</p>

  <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
  <p>We use the information we collect to provide our lead generation and outreach services, including sending B2B outreach emails on behalf of our clients, notifying our clients via SMS and email when leads respond to their campaigns, and facilitating communication between our clients and their prospective customers.</p>

  <h2>SMS Notifications</h2>
  <p>We send SMS notifications to our clients to alert them when a new lead has responded to their outreach campaign. These messages contain the lead's business contact information and a link to respond. Clients opt in to receive SMS notifications when they sign their service agreement with us. Clients may opt out of SMS notifications at any time by replying STOP to any message or by contacting us directly. Message frequency varies based on campaign activity. Message and data rates may apply.</p>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell personal information to third parties. We share lead information only with the specific client whose campaign generated that lead. We may use third-party service providers (such as email platforms, CRM tools, and messaging services) to deliver our services, and these providers are bound by their own privacy policies and data protection obligations.</p>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect the information we handle against unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction. However, no method of transmission over the internet is completely secure.</p>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <p>We retain client and lead information for the duration of our service relationship and for a reasonable period afterward for record-keeping purposes. Clients may request deletion of their data by contacting us.</p>

  <h2>Your Rights</h2>
  <p>You may request access to, correction of, or deletion of your information by contacting us. If you are a California resident, you may have additional rights under the CCPA.</p>

  <h2>Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@theheadlinetheory.com">support@theheadlinetheory.com</a>.</p>
